Average no. calculation program
Steps for executing client and server program.


1. Run rpcgen utility for avg.x

   rpcgen avg.x

2. Client and server stub files, xdr file and header file are created.

   i.e avg_svc.c,avg_clnt.c,avg_xdr.c,avg.h

3. Compile the client program by

   cc client.c avg_clnt.c avg_xdr.c -o client

4. Compile the server program by

   cc server.c avg_svc.c avg_xdr.c -o server

5. Run the server program first by

   ./server

6. Run the client program by

   ./client 127.0.0.1 2 3 4

   Result will be displayed i.e. average no


Note : 127.0.0.1 is loopback address of the same machine where the client and server programs are running


*Note: Client program can be on the any machines.

  For that take the files related to client program

  as client.c, avg_clnt.c,avg_xdr.c,avg.h 
 
  and compile it as given in the step three and run it.

   IP address is the one where the server program is running.
