===Shared memory concept=====

How to run ?
step 1:
	gcc sharedserver.c -o server
	gcc sharedclient.c -o client
	
step 2:
	./server
	./client  (on diff terminal)
	
output :
	server writes char's [a-z] to shared memory
	and client reads those char's from the same memory
	
	---You can see the shared segments using command <ipcs -m> with your segment with key : 5678 in hex
