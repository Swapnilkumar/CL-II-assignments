===Web service creation for simple calculator operations===

Requirements :

	--It will create stub and skeleton, and many required files
	
step 2:
	---server code linking and compiling
	
	gcc -o service calc.cpp soapC.cpp soapServer.cpp -lgsoap++
	
	--service is the executable--server running on port 8000
	--Run the server as
	./service
	
step 3:
	--client seeking for services of calculator
	
	--compile and link using creating <client> as executable
	gcc -o client client.cpp soapC.cpp soapClient.cpp -lgsoap++
	
	--run the client as :
	
	./client
