Shared Memory is a type of IPC where the two processes share same memory chunk and use it for IPC. One process writes into that memory and other reads it.

After running the Server you can see the attached Shared Memory

vgupta80@linux unixprog> ipcs -m

------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x0000162e 65537      vgupta80  666        27         1


After running the client the memory is freed.
